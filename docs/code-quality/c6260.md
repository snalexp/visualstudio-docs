# C6260
warning C6260: sizeof * sizeof is almost always wrong, did you intend to use a character count or a byte count?

 This warning indicates that the results of two `sizeof` operations have been multiplied together. The C/C++ `sizeof` operator returns the number of bytes of storage an object uses. It is typically incorrect to multiply it by another `sizeof` operation; usually one is interested in the number of bytes in an object or the number of elements in an array (for example the number of wide-characters in an array).

 There is some unintuitive behavior associated with `sizeof` operator. For example, in C, the `sizeof ('\0') == 4,` because  a character  is of an integral type. In C++, the type of a character literal is `char`, so `sizeof ('\0') == 1`. However, in both C and C++, the following is true:

```cpp
sizeof ("\0") == 2.
```

## Example
 The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f( )
{
  int i;
  i = sizeof (L"String") * sizeof (WCHAR);
  // code ...
}
```

 To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f( )
{
  // use divide to calculate how many WCHAR characters are in the string
  int i = sizeof (L"String") / sizeof (WCHAR);

  // get the number of bytes in the character array
  int j = sizeof (L"String");

  // code ...
}
```
