# Managed Recommended Rules rule set for managed code

Use the Microsoft Managed Recommended Rules rule set to focus on the most critical problems in your managed code, including potential security holes, application crashes, and other important logic and design errors. This rule set includes all the rules in the [Managed Minimum Rules](managed-minimum-rules-rule-set-for-managed-code.md) rule set.

Include this rule set in any custom rule set that you create for your projects.
