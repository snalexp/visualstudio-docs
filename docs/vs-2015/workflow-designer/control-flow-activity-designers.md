# Control Flow Activity Designers
[!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] includes a number of system-provided activities that you can use when constructing your workflows. This section contains the system-provided activities used to control the flow within a workflow. The following topics describe these activities and provide guidance on how to use them.

## In This Section
 [DoWhile](../workflow-designer/dowhile-activity-designer.md)
 Executes the activity contained in its body at least once, until a specified condition evaluates to **true**.

 [ForEach\<T>](foreach-t-activity-designer.md)
 Executes the activity contained in its body for each item in a specified collection.

 [If](../workflow-designer/if-activity-designer.md)
 Evaluates a condition and executes an activity depending on the results of that evaluation.

 [Parallel](../workflow-designer/parallel-activity-designer.md)
 Executes a collection of child activities concurrently.

 [ParallelForEach\<T>](../workflow-designer/parallelforeach-t-activity-designer.md)
 Enumerates the elements of a collection and executes an embedded statement for each element of the collection in parallel

 [Pick](../workflow-designer/pick-activity-designer.md)
 Executes one of several branches in response to some event that provides event-based flow control.

 [PickBranch](../workflow-designer/pickbranch-activity-designer.md)
 Provides a potential path of execution within a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activity.

 [Sequence](../workflow-designer/sequence-activity-designer.md)
 Contains an ordered collection of child activities that it executes in order.

 [Switch\<T>](switch-t-activity-designer.md)
 Evaluates a specified expression and executes the activity from a collection of activities whose associated key matches the value obtained from the evaluation.

 [While](../workflow-designer/while-activity-designer.md)
 Executes the activity contained in its body while a specified condition evaluates to **true**.
